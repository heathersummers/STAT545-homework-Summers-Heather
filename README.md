### STAT545-hw01-Summers-Heather
## Hello, my name is Heather! 
I am an MSc student in the Department of Geograpghy working under the supervision of Dr. Simon Donner. I will be pursuing research in climate change and the impact that it has on coral reef biomes. 

## Research Experience:
During my undergraduate degree I have had the opportunity to participate in a variety of field courses ranging from
studying the unique geology and environment of Iceland, to the health of the coral reefs in the Caribbean, to the geology and hydrology of the karstic landscape in the Yucat√°n Peninsula, Mexico. During the summers of 2015 and 2016 I completed marine field research projects under the Operation Wallacea program where I learned about marine biodiversity and conservation management strategies. This past summer I worked as part of the Educational and Supervisory Science Staff for Operation Wallacea where I delivered reef ecology lectures and in-water practicals for high school and university students taking the reef ecology course on the Utila marine site in Honduras.
